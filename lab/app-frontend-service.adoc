### Deploy a frontend Service
Duration 3:00

Each Pod has a unique IP address - but the address is ephemeral.  The Pod IP addresses are not stable and it can change when Pods start and/or restart. A service provides a single access point to a set of pods matching some constraints. A Service IP address is stable.

Create the frontend service:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl create -f frontend-service.yaml*
service/frontend-ui created
----

And check it:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl get services*
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP                 PORT(S)        AGE
frontend-ui   LoadBalancer   172.30.58.95   172.29.26.18,172.29.26.18   80:31391/TCP   8s
